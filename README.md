# Bank-Account-Management-System
This program is a basic command-line banking system that enables users to manage their finances efficiently. It offers five core functionalities: depositing funds, withdrawing money, viewing transaction history, checking account details, and saving data before exiting. Each transaction—whether a deposit or withdrawal—is recorded and can be reviewed through the transaction history feature. Upon choosing to save and quit, the program securely writes the entire transaction history to an external file, ensuring that all financial records are preserved for future reference. This makes the program a practical and user-friendly tool for simple personal finance management.
